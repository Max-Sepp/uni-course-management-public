# Uni Course Management System
This system is intended to allow students to plan optional module choices for their degree taking into account how choices in one year affect later choices. The system allows students to trial different routes through a degree and ensures they understand what the constraints on their choices are. The system can cope with rules which vary from year to year and a range of different degrees which use the same options. Students and administrators have dedicated web based portals which are intuitive and quick to learn. 

This is the copy of a private repo which I worked on for my A-level coursework.
